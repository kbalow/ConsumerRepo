# Purpose: use this file to demo private module registry
# Input Variables: number_of_instances, name
# Configuration:
# 1) Fork https://github.com/mocofound/terraform-aws-consumer-elb and Add private module into TFE from 
# 2) Fork https://github.com/mocofound/terraform-aws-consumer-ec2-instance and Add private module into TFE from 
# 3) In code below, for all modules, change module versions appropriatly for your imports (e.g. version = "1.9")
# 4) In code below, for all modules, change source = "" to match your modules source
# 5) Modify variables as needed
# 6) rename file from consumer-frontend-app.nothing to  consumer-frontend-app.tf
